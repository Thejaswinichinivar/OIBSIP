TASK 1. SIMPLE CALCULATOR:-

This is a simple calculator project that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
The HTML file defines the structure of the calculator, including the display area and the buttons for numbers and arithmetic operations.
The CSS file defines the styling of the calculator, including the layout, colours, and typography.
The JavaScript file defines the functionality of the calculator, including handling user input, performing calculations, and updating the display.
The calculator supports the following features:

>Entering numbers and performing arithmetic operations
>Displaying the input and result on the calculator display
>Storing the previous number, current number, and arithmetic operation in variables
>Updating the variables as the user interacts with the calculator
>Handling edge cases like division by zero
>Displaying an error message for invalid input or operations
>Updating the input history to display the user's input and the result
>Centering the calculator on the screen
>Displaying a simple text above the calculator

    The calculator is a simple but useful tool for performing basic arithmetic operations. It can be used as a starting point for building more complex calculators with additional features.



TASK 2. A TRIBUTE PAGE:-

The task is to create a tribute page for Dr. Puneeth Rajkumar using HTML and CSS. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used for structuring and giving meaning to content on the web, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.

To create the tribute page, we first define the structure of the page using HTML, including the headings, paragraphs, images, and any other elements we want to include and this webpage uses internal CSS. In this case, we include a profile picture of Dr. Puneeth Rajkumar, his birth and death dates, and a quote penned by him and some information about him.

Next, we use CSS to style the page and make it visually appealing. We can set the background colour, font style and size, margins and padding, and other visual properties of the elements on the page. In this example, we set a background colour for the body, added a border radius to the profile picture to make it circular, set the font style and size for the birth and death dates and quotes, and added some margin and padding to create space between the elements.

      Overall, the task involves using HTML and CSS to create a tribute page that is both informative and visually appealing, highlighting the life and achievements of Dr. Puneeth Rajkumar.
